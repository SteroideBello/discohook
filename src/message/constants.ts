Hey, this is Discohook, a message and embed builder for Discord webhooks. <:discohook:645409602393079819>
You can read more about how to use Discohook below, or click **Clear all** on the top to start out blank.
Have questions? Discohook has a server at <https://discohook.org/discord>.

Yeah uhh, this is __Discohook__.

This can help you create and send messages for Discord's webhooks, which you can read more about on the [support article](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668).
Webhooks got introduced to send messages to a Discord channel from third party applications, without going trough the hassle of setting up a bot.

If you have the "Manage webhooks" permission for a channel, you can create one in the channel settings.
After that, you can copy the link in here and start sending cool and shiny messages.

This application can help you create unique messages that stand out!
These messages can contain a lot more than just text, but also up to 10 embeds like this one! :sparkles:

      title: "What's an embed?",
      description: `
Originally, embeds got introduced to give everyone reading the chat a hint on what a link will be about,
however since then Discord has expanded the feature and started allowing bots and webhooks to take advantage of this feature, too.
In fact, this entire message can be sent to any Discord channel, given you have permission to create a webhook.

Embeds have many shiny features, like the title and description you're reading right now, but also up to 25 "fields", authors, footers, and even more!
On the editor on your left you can set all properties that embeds can have with ease.

Discord also has a few advanced text formatting features, which are explained below :point_down:

      title: "Markdown",
      description: `
Discord has support for [__***markdown***__](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617), which lets you format text in unique ways.
It's very simple:
- surround your text with \`*\`s to make your text *italic*,
- or use \`**\`s to make your text **bold**,
- or \`__\`s to make your text __underlined__,
- or \`~~\`s to make your text ~~striketrough~~,
- or \`\` \` \`\`s to make your text \`code\`.

Tou can combine multiple styles if you need to, just make sure the order matches up:
\`__**text**__\` results in __**text**__, but \`__**text__**\` results in __**text__**, which is probably not what you want.

          name: "(Custom) Emoji",
          value: `
You can use (custom) emoji in Discohook too.

To use regular emoji, you can use the emoji shortcode (like \`:closed_umbrella:\`) or copy paste a literal emoji (\`ðŸŒ‚\`)
:closed_umbrella: :closed_umbrella: :closed_umbrella:

You can also use a custom emoji by putting a backslash (\\\\) infront of the emoji when sending a message.
Discord will send your message with the raw formatting required to use emoji in webhooks.

          name: "Mentioning users, roles, and channels",
          value: `
You can also mention your members, or tag a channel by using this syntax:
\`<@!user-id>\`, \`<@&role-id>\`, or \`<#channel-id>\`.
As an example, to mention someone: \`<@!143419667677970434>\`. Don't include the user, role, or channel name.
If done correctly, it should show <@!1>, <@&1>, or <#1>. Sadly it's impossible to get the channel name inside of Discohook right now, so make sure the ID is correct!

You can get these IDs by going into Discord's appearance settings, and enabling developer mode.
After you enabled that setting, you can right click on a user, role, or channel to copy it's ID!
